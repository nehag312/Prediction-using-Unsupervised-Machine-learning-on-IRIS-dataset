# TSF-Task2
This is an unsupervised task in which we have to predict the optimum number of clusters from the "IRIS" datasets and also representing it visually.
In this task, I have used the inbuilt function of R "kmeans" which follows the kmean clustering algorithm to cluster the dataset.
I also visalized it using the scatterplot of original dataset and the result obtained from the clustering process.
